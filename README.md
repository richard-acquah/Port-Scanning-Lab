# Port-Scanning-Lab

## Objectives
Port scanning is essential in detecting open ports and services on a network. The labs demonstrate how Nmap is used to map out the network, discover open ports and services and the operating systems of devices on the network. The primary focus of this lab is scanning a virtual network and scanme.nmap.org using Nmap and online port scanners.
